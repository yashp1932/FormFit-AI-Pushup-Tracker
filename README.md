# FormFit: AI Pushup Tracker 🏋️‍♂️🤖

**FormFit** is an AI-powered system that analyzes pushup form in real-time using computer vision and machine learning. It was built to help fitness enthusiasts and athletes improve their form, reduce injury risk, and track performance — all using a simple camera.

## 🚀 Why I Built This

While training at home or at the gym, it’s common to perform pushups with poor form — like flared elbows, incomplete reps, or sagging hips. These subtle mistakes not only reduce effectiveness but can lead to injuries over time. I wanted to solve this using AI.

**FormFit** helps users:
- Get real-time feedback on form
- Improve body awareness and technique
- Train more safely and efficiently

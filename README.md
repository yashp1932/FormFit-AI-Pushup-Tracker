## 🚀 Why I Built This

While training at home or at the gym, it’s common to perform pushups with poor form — like flared elbows, incomplete reps, or sagging hips. These subtle mistakes not only reduce effectiveness but can lead to injuries over time. I wanted to solve this using AI.

**FormFit** helps users:
- Get real-time feedback on form
- Improve body awareness and technique
- Train more safely and efficiently
